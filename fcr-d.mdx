FCR-D is the Nordic grid’s fast-response safety net. Fever turns it into a reliable revenue stream by qualifying your battery, monitoring capacity prices, and dispatching within milliseconds when frequency dips.

For asset owners, providing disturbance reserve used to mean navigating complex technical rules, manual bidding, and 24/7 availability commitments.

Fever automates the entire stack—qualification, bidding, activation, and settlement—so every kilowatt of reserve capacity is monetised without additional operational overhead.

## Who it’s for

Ideal for **commercial and industrial sites**, **multi-site aggregators**, and **large residential batteries** (≥10 kW) in the Nordics that can sustain rapid discharge on short notice and want to stack guaranteed income on top of other optimisation strategies.

## How FCR-D makes it happen

### It guarantees ultra-fast response
Fever’s control stack keeps your asset within FCR-D readiness parameters and reacts in &lt;1 second to frequency deviations.\
**Result:** you meet Fingrid/Svenska kraftnät compliance on every activation.

### It locks in premium capacity payments
Daily price forecasts identify the highest-paying FCR-D windows. Fever bids your available capacity and reserves it automatically.\
**Result:** predictable revenue, paid whether or not an activation occurs.

### It stacks markets intelligently
FCR-D availability is balanced with arbitrage, peak shaving, and backup needs on an hour-by-hour basis.\
**Result:** maximum asset utilization without violating reserve commitments.

## How it works: Automated reserve orchestration

<Steps>
  <Step title="Qualify & configure">
    Fever audits battery specifications, verifies telemetry latency, and files market participation paperwork. Control limits are configured to maintain state-of-charge within the reserve band.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Price & availability forecasting">
    Day-ahead and intraday capacity prices are modelled against your asset’s availability to determine optimal hourly bids while preserving other commitments (backup, peak shaving, etc.).
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated bidding">
    Fever submits capacity bids via the TSO interface and monitors acceptance. Confirmed bids lock the reserved energy window and update the live operations console.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activation & settlement">
    When frequency breaches 49.90 Hz, Fever dispatches the battery in milliseconds, logs delivery, and reconciles capacity plus activation payments with transparent reporting.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Revenue snapshot: 50 kW commercial battery (24h window)

| Hour block | Capacity price (kr/MW/h) | Reserved capacity | Daily capacity revenue |
| ---------- | ------------------------ | ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| 00:00–06:00 | 142 | 0.05 MW | 42.60 kr |
| 06:00–12:00 | 118 | 0.05 MW | 35.40 kr |
| 12:00–18:00 | 165 | 0.05 MW | 49.50 kr |
| 18:00–24:00 | 178 | 0.05 MW | 53.40 kr |
| **Total (no activation)** |  |  | **180.90 kr/day** |

<success>
  **Activation bonus:** On a disturbance event, a 50 kW discharge for 8 minutes at 2.5 kr/kWh adds **16.70 kr** incremental revenue for that day.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is the minimum system size?">
    Fever typically onboards systems ≥10 kW with at least 20 kWh usable capacity. Smaller batteries can participate through our aggregation pool.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I exit the market on short notice?">
    Yes. Availability can be toggled daily. Fever maintains fallback schedules so you can pause participation for maintenance or operational needs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does FCR-D limit my ability to provide backup power?">
    No. Reserve bands are configured to keep sufficient headroom for backup commitments. When backup mode engages, Fever automatically drops FCR-D bids.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are payments handled?">
    Fever invoices the TSO on your behalf, deducts the service fee, and remits net revenue monthly with full transparency.
