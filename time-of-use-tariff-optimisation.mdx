# Let Your Appliances Chase Cheap Power

**Time-of-Use Tariff Optimisation runs power-hungry devices when prices drop.**

The service checks tomorrow’s price curve and lines up each controllable appliance with the cheapest hour. No more guessing when to run the washer or the heat pump.

Manual timers and reminders are easy to forget. We automate the plan end-to-end so every flexible device sticks to low-cost windows without daily effort from you.

## Who's it for

Households on **Time-of-Use tariffs** that want bill savings without micromanaging appliances. Ideal for homes running smart plugs, programmable heat pumps, EV chargers, and other shiftable loads.

## How it works

![Diagram showing price forecasts feeding an optimisation engine that dispatches smart plugs, EV chargers, and heat pumps into cheap hours.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Connect devices:** Link smart plugs, EV chargers, heat pumps, and schedulable appliances through the automation hub.
2. **Set preferences:** Define comfort bands, ready-by times, and priority levels for each load.
3. **Optimise nightly:** Every afternoon the engine pulls tomorrow's price data, scores thousands of schedule combinations, and deploys the cheapest plan that respects comfort constraints.
4. **Execute & learn:** Appliances run on the optimised schedule while the system learns actual runtimes to improve future decisions.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="17:00 - Forecast ready">
    Tomorrow's price curve reveals a deep trough from 01:00-05:00 and a secondary dip at 11:00.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:00 - Loads analysed">
    Dishwasher (2 h), heat-pump pre-heating (1.5 h), EV charger (20 kWh), and water heater (45 min) are all flagged as flexible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="19:00 - Plan committed">
    Dishwasher and EV charge are pushed to 01:00, water heater to 04:30 finish, heat pump pre-heats at 05:30 to carry warmth through breakfast.
  </Step>
  <Step title="07:00 - Morning check-in">
    All devices completed inside their cheapest windows. Compared to peak-time operation, the household saved **42 kr** overnight.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why it matters now

Spot price volatility is rising across Europe. Electricity now swings **5-10×** between peak and trough within a single day. Automation that consistently lands usage in the trough is the fastest path to material bill savings—no solar panels required.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Can I override the schedule?">
    Absolutely. You can always run appliances immediately from the app. The optimiser resumes on the next cycle.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need smart plugs everywhere?">
    No. We integrate with the equipment you already have—EV chargers, heat pumps, appliances with built-in scheduling—and only recommend smart plugs where gaps exist.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if spot prices rarely go negative?">
    The optimiser still shifts usage into the lowest-cost windows. When volatility is low, savings are smaller but still positive; during volatile seasons the benefit compounds quickly.
