# What If Every Kilowatt-Hour Hit the Lowest Rate?

**Time-of-Use Tariff Optimisation. Lower your bills without changing your lifestyle ‚Äî we run appliances when power is cheap.**

Time-of-Use Tariff Optimisation automatically orchestrates your energy-hungry loads so they run when electricity prices are lowest. Instead of guessing when to run the washer, dishwasher, or heat pump, the system maps every controllable device to the best-priced hour‚Äîevery single day.

Traditional approaches rely on manual timers and vigilance. This optimisation removes the friction, combining price forecasts, appliance flexibility, and user preferences to squeeze the most value out of ToU tariffs with zero daily effort.

## Who it's for

Households on **Time-of-Use tariffs** that want bill savings without micromanaging appliances. Ideal for homes running smart plugs, programmable heat pumps, EV chargers, and other shiftable loads.

## How Time-of-Use Tariff Optimisation makes it happen

### ‚è±Ô∏è It finds the cheapest windows automatically

The system ingests day-ahead price curves and maps each controllable appliance to the cheapest feasible slot based on runtime, warmup/cooldown tolerances, and user deadlines.\
**Result:** appliances run when prices are **30-70% lower** than the daytime peak.

### ü§ñ It coordinates every smart device

Smart plugs, automated schedulers, EV chargers, and heat pumps are synchronised through a single automation layer. Conflicts are resolved automatically so devices with overlapping needs never spike demand together.\
**Result:** consistent savings and smooth comfort without manual juggling.

### üõ°Ô∏è It protects comfort and routines

User-defined guardrails ensure hot water is ready, rooms stay comfortable, and EVs are charged on time. The optimisation respects lifestyle constraints while still chasing the lowest possible cost.\
**Result:** **lower bills with zero lifestyle compromise.**

## How It Works: Smart Scheduling Meets Real-Time Prices

![Diagram showing price forecasts feeding an optimisation engine that dispatches smart plugs, EV chargers, and heat pumps into cheap hours.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Connect devices:** Link smart plugs, EV chargers, heat pumps, and schedulable appliances through the automation hub.
2. **Set preferences:** Define comfort bands, ready-by times, and priority levels for each load.
3. **Optimise nightly:** Every afternoon the engine pulls tomorrow's price data, scores thousands of schedule combinations, and deploys the cheapest plan that respects comfort constraints.
4. **Execute & learn:** Appliances run on the optimised schedule while the system learns actual runtimes to improve future decisions.

## ToU Optimisation in Action: A Typical Evening

<Steps>
  <Step title="17:00 - Forecast ready">
    Tomorrow's price curve reveals a deep trough from 01:00-05:00 and a secondary dip at 11:00.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:00 - Loads analysed">
    Dishwasher (2 h), heat-pump pre-heating (1.5 h), EV charger (20 kWh), and water heater (45 min) are all flagged as flexible.
  </Step>
  <Step title="19:00 - Plan committed">
    Dishwasher and EV charge are pushed to 01:00, water heater to 04:30 finish, heat pump pre-heats at 05:30 to carry warmth through breakfast.
  </Step>
  <Step title="07:00 - Morning check-in">
    All devices completed inside their cheapest windows. Compared to peak-time operation, the household saved **42 kr** overnight.
  </Step>

## Why it matters now

Spot price volatility is rising across Europe. Electricity now swings **5-10√ó** between peak and trough within a single day. Automation that consistently lands usage in the trough is the fastest path to material bill savings‚Äîno solar panels required.
