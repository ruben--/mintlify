# Go Beyond Single-Market Trading

**Grid Flexibility Services. Coordinate every eligible asset across the full stack of Nordic flexibility markets.**

Our optimisation layer continuously scans market conditions, matching the right asset to the most lucrative opportunity in real time. Batteries, EVs, and other controllable loads can earn revenue by supporting grid stability while still serving the home or business.

## What We Do

- **Multi-market optimisation** ensures every dispatch decision balances current price signals, asset availability, and lifecycle constraints.
- **Market participation across FCR-D, FCR-N, mFRR, and emerging flexibility programmes** lets us stack revenue streams based on each assetâ€™s performance envelope.
- **Asset-specific orchestration** adapts control strategies to the technical limits of batteries, EVs, thermal storage, and industrial loads to keep earnings high without compromising lifespan.

## Why It Matters

By operating in several markets simultaneously, we smooth revenue volatility and capture upside whenever flexibility is scarce. Customers see higher, more predictable earnings while the grid gains responsive capacity exactly when it is needed.
