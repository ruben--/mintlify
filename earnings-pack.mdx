Earnings Pack is the advanced energy trading platform that transforms your battery from a cost center into a profit center—automatically trading energy, providing grid services, and generating revenue 24/7.

For decades, batteries were just backup power: expensive insurance sitting idle most of the time.

That era is over. Your battery can now be an active participant in energy markets, generating real income through arbitrage, frequency regulation, and grid stabilization services.

Earnings Pack is the intelligent platform that unlocks your battery's earning potential. It handles the complexity of front-of-meter trading—FCR-D, FCR-N, energy arbitrage, and more—turning your storage asset into a continuously optimized revenue stream.

## Who it's for

Perfect for battery owners in **Sweden** and the **Nordics**—whether residential, commercial, or utility-scale—who want to maximize ROI by participating in lucrative energy markets and grid service programs.

---

## How Earnings Pack makes it happen

### ↑ It generates continuous revenue

Earnings Pack's AI automatically trades energy across multiple revenue streams: buying low and selling high (arbitrage), providing frequency regulation (FCR-D, FCR-N), and delivering grid stabilization services.\
**Result:** earn **15,000 - 80,000 SEK annually** per 10 kWh of battery capacity, depending on market conditions and service mix.

### ⚡ It stacks revenue streams

Why choose one revenue source when you can optimize across multiple markets simultaneously? Earnings Pack dynamically allocates your battery capacity to the most profitable opportunities in real-time.\
**Result:** **2-4x higher returns** compared to single-service strategies.

### ✓ It makes trading effortless

Earnings Pack handles bidding, compliance, real-time dispatch, and settlement across complex markets. The entire process is **fully automated**—you collect earnings without lifting a finger.

## How It Works: Intelligence in Front of the Meter

Earnings Pack isn't guesswork; it's algorithmic trading and grid optimization working around the clock for your bottom line.

## Revenue Streams Explained

### Energy Arbitrage
Buy electricity when prices are low, sell when they're high. Simple concept, complex execution. Earnings Pack does it automatically across hourly and intraday markets.

**Typical Annual Revenue:** 8,000 - 25,000 SEK per 10 kWh

### FCR-D (Frequency Containment Reserve - Disturbance)
Get paid to keep the grid stable during major frequency disturbances. Your battery stands ready to inject or absorb power within seconds when the grid needs it.

**Typical Annual Revenue:** 12,000 - 45,000 SEK per 10 kWh

### FCR-N (Frequency Containment Reserve - Normal)
Provide continuous, automatic frequency regulation to keep the grid at exactly 50 Hz. Your battery constantly balances small grid fluctuations.

**Typical Annual Revenue:** 15,000 - 55,000 SEK per 10 kWh

### mFRR (Manual Frequency Restoration Reserve)
Get dispatched manually to help restore grid frequency after disturbances. Less frequent activations, but highly lucrative when called.

**Typical Annual Revenue:** 5,000 - 18,000 SEK per 10 kWh

### Peak Shaving Services
Provide capacity to commercial or industrial clients during peak demand periods, helping them avoid expensive demand charges.

**Typical Annual Revenue:** 8,000 - 30,000 SEK per 10 kWh

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>

  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do you protect my battery's health?">
    Earnings Pack continuously monitors state-of-charge, temperature, cycle depth, and degradation. We optimize for lifetime revenue, not short-term gains, ensuring your battery lasts as long as possible.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I want to use my battery for backup power?">
    You set the rules. Reserve any amount of capacity for backup or self-consumption, and Earnings Pack will optimize the rest. Your backup needs always come first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Are there market qualification requirements?">
