Day-ahead plans rarely survive contact with reality. Weather shifts, interconnector outages, and forecast errors swing Nordic prices by the hour. Fever‚Äôs Intraday Optimisation watches every tick, reshaping charging, discharging, and load schedules so you profit from those surprise spreads.

No more manual rebids or late-night alerts‚ÄîFever automates intraday strategy with the same intelligence used for arbitrage, reserve stacking, and peak shaving.

## Who it‚Äôs for

Built for **BRPs**, **asset owners**, and **energy retailers** managing flexible portfolios that need constant re-optimisation between day-ahead and delivery.

## How Intraday Optimisation makes it happen

### üîç It senses market shifts instantly
Live feeds from Nord Pool, weather models, and imbalance prices trigger re-optimisation within seconds.\
**Result:** you react to spreads before competitors can place manual orders.

### üß† It replans across every asset
Batteries, EV fleets, heat pumps, and industrial loads are re-dispatched with respect to constraints and commitments.\
**Result:** maximum value capture without breaking customer promises or reserve bids.

### üßæ It records every rebid and outcome
All intraday transactions, forecast deltas, and energy deliveries are logged for settlement and portfolio analytics.\
**Result:** crystal-clear profit tracking and compliance evidence.

## How it works: Continuous intraday loop

![Diagram showing data feeds entering Fever‚Äôs intraday engine with schedules published back to assets.](/images/hero-light.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Monitor markets">
    Fever ingests price curves, imbalance signals, and weather updates every minute, comparing against day-ahead positions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Trigger optimisation">
    When price deltas breach configurable thresholds, a new optimisation run evaluates charge/discharge, load shifting, and buy/sell options.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Execute + publish">
    Updated schedules are dispatched to assets and trades are lodged through the BRP‚Äôs intraday interface.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Settle + learn">
    Delivered energy is reconciled, with performance data feeding machine-learning models to improve future triggers.
  </Step>
</Steps>
