FCR-N keeps Nordic grid frequency inside the tight 49.9‚Äì50.1 Hz corridor by charging or discharging instantly. Fever handles the technical qualifications, symmetric dispatch, and settlements so your battery earns dependable income every hour of the day.

Unlike ad-hoc trading, FCR-N demands uncompromising availability, telemetry, and reporting. Fever‚Äôs orchestration stack manages those constraints automatically, letting you concentrate on asset strategy instead of operational checklists.

## Who it‚Äôs for

Best suited for **utility-scale and commercial batteries** (‚â•50 kW) and **aggregated residential fleets** that can maintain mid-state-of-charge and provide equal up/down power on short notice.

---

## How FCR-N makes it happen

### üîÅ It delivers symmetric flexibility
Fever keeps assets centred at 50% state-of-charge and mirrors charge/discharge power to satisfy symmetric reserve requirements.\
**Result:** frictionless compliance with Svenska kraftn√§t and Fingrid rulebooks.

### üí∏ It monetizes every available hour
Hourly price forecasts, acceptance probabilities, and maintenance windows feed into Fever‚Äôs bidding engine.\
**Result:** near-constant capacity revenue, even on quiet grid days.

### üß© It coexists with other services
Reserve bands are dynamically sized so the same asset can stack arbitrage, peak shaving, or backup commitments without risking penalties.\
**Result:** higher portfolio yield from the same hardware.

## How it works: Symmetric automation in four steps

![Diagram showing Fever balancing charge and discharge in response to small frequency deviations.](/images/hero-dark.png)

<Steps>
  <Step title="Qualification & telemetry">
    Fever validates inverter ramp rates, installs secure telemetry, and submits compliance documentation to the TSO.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Dynamic banding">
    Machine learning models right-size symmetric power bands based on forecasted volatility, battery health, and other market commitments.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Bid execution">
    The platform places hourly bids, prioritizing the best-paying windows while preserving planned downtime or customer-defined exceptions.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Automated settlement">
    Delivered energy is reconciled against TSO metering with transparent statements, dispute handling, and consolidated payouts.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How is symmetric capacity enforced?">
    Fever‚Äôs controller locks charge and discharge power to equal magnitudes and clamps SoC around the midpoint using predictive balancing.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can FCR-N run alongside FCR-D?">
    Yes. Fever schedules separate capacity blocks for normal and disturbance reserves, ensuring combined commitments never exceed technical limits.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What‚Äôs the minimum commitment period?">
    Capacity can be offered hourly, but TSOs expect high availability. Fever helps design participation strategies that respect asset constraints.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are penalties handled?">
    If performance falls short, Fever flags the root cause, manages remediation with the TSO, and adjusts future bids to avoid repeat issues.
  </Accordion>
