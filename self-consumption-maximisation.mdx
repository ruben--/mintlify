# What If Every Solar Electron Stayed in Your Home?

**Self-Consumption Maximisation. Maximise the value of your solar investment ‚Äî keep and use your energy.**

Self-Consumption Maximisation ensures the solar you produce is the solar you use. By pairing storage, smart inverters, and appliance orchestration, it soaks up excess generation, stores it, and dispatches it exactly when your household needs it most.

Instead of exporting at low feed-in tariffs, you bank surplus in a home battery, shift flexible loads into sunny hours, and let automation make sure every kilowatt-hour offsets expensive grid imports.

---

## Who's it for

Solar households facing **low or declining feed-in tariffs** who want to capture the full value of their generation. Especially powerful for homes with batteries or flexible loads like EV charging, heat pumps, and domestic hot water.

---

## What's the value

### ‚òÄÔ∏è It captures surplus solar automatically

Smart inverters sense excess production and route it into batteries or flexible loads before exporting.\
**Result:** more on-site usage, less energy sold back for pennies.

### üß† It orchestrates demand around sunshine

Appliance automation shifts EV charging, laundry, and hot water production into midday generation peaks.\
**Result:** higher self-consumption percentages and lower evening imports.

### üîã It dispatches stored energy intelligently

When the sun sets, stored kWh are released to cover evening peaks while preserving backup reserves.\
**Result:** minimal grid dependence and resilient nighttime comfort.

## How it works

![Diagram showing solar array feeding battery and smart loads during the day, then battery feeding household at night.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Monitor generation & load:** Real-time metering tracks production, household consumption, and battery state of charge.
2. **Prioritise on-site use:** Automation directs excess solar to batteries, EVs, or pre-heating before considering export.
3. **Optimise discharge:** During high-tariff evening periods, the system discharges stored energy while keeping a safety reserve.
4. **Learn & refine:** Daily performance is analysed to adjust charge/discharge windows and load shifting rules.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="10:00 - Solar surplus detected">
    PV array produces 6 kW while the home uses 3 kW. Extra 3 kW is diverted to the 10 kWh battery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="12:00 - Load orchestration">
    Dishwasher and laundry start automatically while generation is highest, boosting on-site use to 95%.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:30 - Sunset transition">
    Battery discharges 4 kW to cover cooking and lighting, avoiding peak-grid imports worth 2.1 kr/kWh.
  </Step>
  <Step title="23:00 - Reserve maintained">
    Battery rests at 30% state of charge for overnight backup, ready for tomorrow's cycle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why it matters now

Feed-in tariffs across Europe have fallen below retail prices, eroding export value. Maximising self-consumption locks in savings, accelerates payback, and builds resilience against policy shifts.

---

## Pricing

### Residential plan

Self-consumption maximisation is part of Savings Pack for homeowners. Pricing starts with a **2,990 SEK** setup and **199 SEK/month** ongoing optimisation.

### Commercial plan

Multi-dwelling and SME deployments include advanced metering and load controls. Expect **9,900 - 24,900 SEK** setup depending on scope, with **990 - 2,490 SEK/month** for orchestration and reporting.

## Installation

We integrate remotely with your inverter, battery, EV charger, and smart appliances. On-site visits are only required if you need new sensors or CT clamps, keeping installation fast and non-intrusive.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will this work without a battery?">
    Yes. Load shifting alone increases self-consumption. Adding a battery simply raises the ceiling and improves evening coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I still export when prices are attractive?">
    You decide the priorities. Set export thresholds so the system prefers self-use until tariffs exceed your target margin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much self-consumption can I expect?">
    Most homes jump from 35-45% to 70-90% self-consumption depending on hardware. We model your baseline before deployment.
