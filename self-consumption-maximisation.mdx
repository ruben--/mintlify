<Info>
**The pitch:** Keep your solar power instead of exporting it for pennies.\
**Savings:** Use 80-95% of your own solar instead of buying from the grid.\
**Who it's for:** Solar households with batteries, EVs, or flexible loads.
</Info>

# Keep the Solar You Generate

**Self-Consumption Maximisation keeps your solar power in your home.**

Your panels do their best work while the house is quiet. This service stores that extra energy and runs flexible appliances while the sun is out, so you pull far less from the grid later.

Instead of exporting for a few öre, you bank surplus in a home battery, shift charging and heating into sunny hours, and let automation cover the expensive evening peaks.

---

## Who it's for

Solar households across the Nordics with **low feed-in tariffs** that want to keep their own power. Works best if you have—or plan to add—a battery, EV charger, heat pump, or other flexible load.

## What's the value

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Capture midday surplus" icon="sun">
    Smart inverters push extra solar into your battery or flexible loads before it leaks to the grid.\
    **Result:** more of your generation stays on-site.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Run big loads when sunshine is free" icon="brain">
    Automation schedules EV charging, hot water, and other flexible jobs for sunny hours.\
    **Result:** evening imports shrink without you changing routines.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use stored energy at night" icon="battery-charging">
    After sunset the system releases just enough stored kWh to cover peaks while guarding a backup reserve.\
    **Result:** lower bills and reliable comfort when the grid price spikes.

## How it works

![Diagram showing solar array feeding battery and smart loads during the day, then battery feeding household at night.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Monitor generation & load:** Real-time metering tracks production, household consumption, and battery state of charge.
2. **Prioritise on-site use:** Automation directs excess solar to batteries, EVs, or pre-heating before considering export.
3. **Optimise discharge:** During high-tariff evening periods, the system discharges stored energy while keeping a safety reserve.
4. **Learn & refine:** Daily performance is analysed to adjust charge/discharge windows and load shifting rules.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="10:00 - Solar surplus detected">
    PV array produces 6 kW while the home uses 3 kW. Extra 3 kW is diverted to the 10 kWh battery.
  </Step>
  <Step title="12:00 - Load orchestration">
    Dishwasher and laundry start automatically while generation is highest, boosting on-site use to 95%.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:30 - Sunset transition">
    Battery discharges 4 kW to cover cooking and lighting, avoiding peak-grid imports worth 2.1 kr/kWh.
  </Step>
  <Step title="23:00 - Reserve maintained">
    Battery rests at 30% state of charge for overnight backup, ready for tomorrow's cycle.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why it matters now

Feed-in tariffs across Europe have fallen below retail prices, eroding export value. Maximising self-consumption locks in savings, accelerates payback, and builds resilience against policy shifts.

---

## Pricing

### Residential plan

Self-consumption maximisation is part of Savings Pack for homeowners. Pricing starts with a **2,990 SEK** setup and **199 SEK/month** ongoing optimisation.

### Commercial plan

Multi-dwelling and SME deployments include advanced metering and load controls. Expect **9,900 - 24,900 SEK** setup depending on scope, with **990 - 2,490 SEK/month** for orchestration and reporting.

## Installation

We integrate remotely with your inverter, battery, EV charger, and smart appliances. On-site visits are only required if you need new sensors or CT clamps, keeping installation fast and non-intrusive.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Will this work without a battery?">
    Yes. Load shifting alone increases self-consumption. Adding a battery simply raises the ceiling and improves evening coverage.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I still export when prices are attractive?">
    You decide the priorities. Set export thresholds so the system prefers self-use until tariffs exceed your target margin.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How much self-consumption can I expect?">
    Most homes jump from 35-45% to 70-90% self-consumption depending on hardware. We model your baseline before deployment.
