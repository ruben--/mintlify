# What If Your Home Traded Like a Power Plant?

**Real-Time Wholesale Price Arbitrage. Charge when power is cheapest, sell back when prices spike.**

Real-Time Wholesale Price Arbitrage turns your home into a nimble market participant. In regions where households access spot pricing (Nordics, Australia, ERCOT), it automates buy-low, sell-high behaviour across batteries, EVs, and flexible loads.

Instead of passively consuming, your assets monitor price feeds, seize low-cost hours to charge, and export or curtail when prices surgeâ€”often generating revenue comparable to utility-scale assets.

## Who's it for

Households with **wholesale tariff access** and controllable batteries or bidirectional EVs. Perfect for energy prosumers who want to extract value from price volatility without trading manually.

---

## What's the value

### ðŸ“Š It reads the market continuously

Live spot prices, imbalance markets, and ancillary opportunities feed into a decision engine every 5 minutes.\
**Result:** assets respond to market shifts faster than any manual intervention.

### âš¡ It executes profitable charge/discharge cycles

When prices drop, batteries and EVs absorb power. When they spike, the system discharges back to the grid or curtails flexible loads.\
**Result:** **net positive cashflow** even after accounting for round-trip efficiency.

### ðŸ§® It manages risk automatically

The automation respects battery cycle limits, ensures EV readiness, and applies guardrails against negative spreads.\
**Result:** consistent gains with hardware protection and lifestyle assurance.

## How it works

1. **Connect market data:** Stream real-time and day-ahead prices plus grid service markets where available.
2. **Model flexibility:** Define capacity, ramp rates, and availability windows for each controllable asset.
3. **Optimise continuously:** Algorithm scores charge/discharge actions against current prices, forecasted spreads, and hardware constraints.
4. **Dispatch automatically:** Commands execute via smart chargers, inverters, or EMS platforms with second-level latency.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="01:00 - Price trough">
    Spot price dips to 0.08 USD/kWh. Battery charges 12 kWh while EV tops up 15 kWh for upcoming commute.
  </Step>
  <Step title="09:00 - Market calm">
    Assets idle, waiting for price signals above 0.20 USD/kWh to consider discharge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="17:30 - Scarcity alert">
    Prices jump to 2.75 USD/kWh. Battery exports 10 kWh, EV dispatches 5 kWh through V2H, and dishwasher cycle is postponed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:15 - Profit locked">
    Net gain for the event: **+48 USD** after accounting for round-trip losses and tariffs. EV remains at 70%â€”above the 60% minimum.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why it matters now

Wholesale markets are more volatile than ever, with intraday spreads exceeding 20Ã— during scarcity events. Homes that automate arbitrage capture value previously reserved for utilitiesâ€”without sacrificing comfort or vehicle readiness.

---

## Pricing

### Residential plan

Arbitrage automation is offered as part of Earnings Pack for home batteries. Expect a **4,990 SEK** setup and a **15% revenue share** so fees scale with performance.

### Commercial plan

For larger sites we scope bespoke trading strategies across multiple markets. Typical engagements involve **custom onboarding** and a **10-20% revenue share** depending on available capacity.

---

## Installation

We integrate with your inverter, battery management system, or V2G charger via APIs. Market registration and compliance paperwork are handled on your behalfâ€”most homes go live in **2-3 weeks**, commercial assets in **3-6 weeks**.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What markets do you support?">
    We currently deploy in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and ERCOT where household access to wholesale pricing exists. New regions are evaluated quarterly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do you protect battery health?">
    Dispatch decisions factor cycle depth, temperature, and degradation models. We target long-term net value, not short-term spikes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reserve capacity for backup?">
    Yes. You choose minimum state-of-charge levels so arbitrage never compromises critical reserves or EV readiness.
