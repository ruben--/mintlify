<Info>
**The pitch:** Buy electricity when it's cheap, sell when it's expensive—automatically.\
**Revenue:** 8,000-25,000 SEK/year per 10 kWh (depends on price volatility).\
**Who it's for:** Batteries or EVs with wholesale tariff access who want to profit from price swings.
</Info>

# Trade Like a Power Plant From Your Living Room

**Real-Time Wholesale Price Arbitrage charges low and sells high automatically.**

The service uses your battery, EV, and flexible loads to buy power when it's cheap and sell or avoid usage when prices spike.

It watches spot prices, charges during troughs, and exports or pauses loads during peaks—delivering revenue that rivals commercial traders without manual effort.

## Who's it for

Households with **wholesale tariff access** and controllable batteries or bidirectional EVs. Perfect for energy prosumers who want to extract value from price volatility without trading manually.

## How it works

![Diagram showing wholesale price feed entering optimisation engine that controls battery charging/discharging and flexible loads.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Connect market data:** Stream real-time and day-ahead prices plus grid service markets where available.
2. **Model flexibility:** Define capacity, ramp rates, and availability windows for each controllable asset.
3. **Optimise continuously:** Algorithm scores charge/discharge actions against current prices, forecasted spreads, and hardware constraints.
4. **Dispatch automatically:** Commands execute via smart chargers, inverters, or EMS platforms with second-level latency.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="01:00 - Price trough">
    Spot price dips to 0.08 USD/kWh. Battery charges 12 kWh while EV tops up 15 kWh for upcoming commute.
  </Step>
  <Step title="09:00 - Market calm">
    Assets idle, waiting for price signals above 0.20 USD/kWh to consider discharge.
  </Step>
  <Step title="17:30 - Scarcity alert">
    Prices jump to 2.75 USD/kWh. Battery exports 10 kWh, EV dispatches 5 kWh through V2H, and dishwasher cycle is postponed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:15 - Profit locked">
    Net gain for the event: **+48 USD** after accounting for round-trip losses and tariffs. EV remains at 70%—above the 60% minimum.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Arbitrage automation is offered as part of Earnings Pack for home batteries. Expect a **4,990 SEK** setup and a **15% revenue share** so fees scale with performance.

### Commercial plan

For larger sites we scope bespoke trading strategies across multiple markets. Typical engagements involve **custom onboarding** and a **10-20% revenue share** depending on available capacity.

---

## Installation

We integrate with your inverter, battery management system, or V2G charger via APIs. Market registration and compliance paperwork are handled on your behalf—most homes go live in **2-3 weeks**, commercial assets in **3-6 weeks**.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What markets do you support?">
    We currently deploy in Sweden, Norway, Finland, Denmark, and ERCOT where household access to wholesale pricing exists. New regions are evaluated quarterly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do you protect battery health?">
    Dispatch decisions factor cycle depth, temperature, and degradation models. We target long-term net value, not short-term spikes.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I reserve capacity for backup?">
    Yes. You choose minimum state-of-charge levels so arbitrage never compromises critical reserves or EV readiness.
