Espen is the small, smart box that slashes your bill, earns you money, and makes smart energy effortless with your existing solar, battery, and EV charger.

For decades, the energy bill has been a one-way street: you use power, the grid sends you a bill—unpredictable and uncontrollable.

That era is over. Your home can now be an intelligent participant in the energy market, not just a passive consumer.

Espen is the small, smart box that transforms your relationship with energy. It acts as the brain for your solar, battery, and EV charger, turning isolated hardware into a coordinated, income-generating asset.

## What's the value

### ↓ It slashes your bill

Espen’s AI constantly monitors hourly prices, buying and storing grid power when it’s cheap, and running your home from your battery when grid prices spike.\
**Result:** reduce monthly energy costs by **up to 50%**.

### ↑ It generates real income

Espen acts as your personal energy trader, selling your excess energy back to the grid at the most profitable moments.\
**Result:** your “bill” can include **earnings**.

## How it works

Espen isn't magic; it's just incredibly smart. It uses data to make the best financial decision for your home's energy every minute of the day.

1. **Connect & Monitor:** Espen securely connects to your smart meter's P1/HAN port, your hardware, and the Nord Pool spot price feed.
2. **Predict & Plan:** Our AI analyzes price forecasts, weather data, and your unique energy usage patterns to create an optimal 24-hour plan.
3. **Automate & Execute:** Espen automatically tells your battery when to charge from the grid (at the lowest price), when to power your home (at the highest price), and when to sell back for a profit.
