# What If Your Home Never Spiked When the Grid Did?

**Peak Shaving & Load Shifting. Cut peak demand charges and support a more reliable grid.**

Peak Shaving & Load Shifting keeps your household demand smooth when the grid is stressed. By coordinating batteries, EVs, and thermal storage, it caps your peak draw and shifts flexible consumption so you avoid expensive peak charges and blackout risks.

Instead of reacting with manual overrides, the optimisation forecasts peaks hours ahead, then reshapes your load curve automatically‚Äîcharging assets off-peak and discharging strategically when your usage or prices spike.

---

## Who's it for

Homes and microbusinesses facing **high peak demand fees** or grid stress events. Ideal for properties with home batteries, bidirectional EVs, or thermal storage that can absorb or release energy on command.

---

## What's the value

### üìâ It predicts and flattens peaks

Machine learning anticipates when household demand will crest‚Äîdinner prep, sauna sessions, EV charging‚Äîand pre-charges batteries or thermal stores ahead of time.\
**Result:** the system discharges through the peak, keeping grid draw below fee-triggering thresholds.

### üîÅ It shifts flexible loads automatically

Dishwashers, laundry, and other deferrable loads are held back during stressed grid periods and released into cheaper, lower-demand windows.\
**Result:** **lower per-kWh costs** and reduced strain on local distribution networks.

### ‚ö° It orchestrates storage and generation

Home batteries, discharge-to-home EVs, and hot water tanks coordinate in real time. Storage assets handle peaks while solar or grid power refills them later when demand is low.\
**Result:** maximised self-reliance and **resilient grid participation.**

## How it works

![Diagram showing forecast analytics charging a battery before peak, then discharging during the high-load window while flexible loads pause.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Forecast load & prices:** Using smart meter data, weather, and occupancy signals, the engine flags likely peak intervals 12-24 hours in advance.
2. **Stage assets:** Batteries and EVs charge beforehand during cheap hours; thermal stores pre-heat or pre-cool while prices are low.
3. **Shave the peak:** During the predicted window, the system discharges storage and defers flexible loads so net grid import stays flat.
4. **Recover smartly:** After the peak, deferred loads resume and storage refills once prices normalize.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="15:00 - Forecast detects spike">
    Weather + occupancy models forecast a 7 kW household peak between 17:30-19:00 due to EV charging and cooking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="16:00 - Assets charge off-peak">
    Home battery tops up to 90% using low midday rates. EV charging is postponed with a ready-by time of 07:00.
  </Step>
  <Step title="17:30 - Peak begins">
    Battery discharges at 3.5 kW, hot water tank switches to stored heat, dishwasher cycle is delayed 90 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="19:00 - Peak avoided">
    Metered draw never exceeds 3.2 kW. Demand charge threshold (5 kW) is never hit, avoiding **450 kr** in penalties this month.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why it matters now

Utilities across Europe and North America are increasing demand charges and rolling out dynamic peak pricing. Homes that stay flat avoid punitive fees and contribute to a more resilient, decarbonised grid.

---

## Pricing

### Residential plan

Peak shaving is bundled with Savings Pack for homeowners. Expect a **2,990 SEK** onboarding and **199 SEK/month** subscription that covers forecasting, automation, and continuous tuning.

### Commercial plan

Larger premises with complex load profiles are priced by scope. Typical deployments range from **9,900 - 29,900 SEK** for setup, plus **990 - 2,490 SEK/month** for monitoring and optimisation.

## Installation

No invasive work is required: we connect to your smart meter, battery gateway, EV charger, and controllable loads through APIs. Technicians only visit if you need additional CT clamps or smart relays installed.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a battery to benefit?">
    Batteries increase the payoff, but homes with thermal storage or shiftable loads still avoid demand charges. We model impact before deployment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this interfere with my daily routines?">
    No. You set comfort and availability limits. The system stays within those guardrails while smoothing your load curve.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How quickly does the system react to unexpected peaks?">
    Real-time monitoring adjusts dispatch in seconds. If a surprise spike appears, peak shaving kicks in automatically.
