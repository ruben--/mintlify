<Info>
**The pitch:** Flatten demand spikes to avoid expensive peak fees.\
**Savings:** Reduce or eliminate peak demand charges on your bill.\
**Who it's for:** Homes and businesses with batteries facing high peak demand fees.

# Stay Under Peak Demand Fees Automatically

**Peak Shaving & Load Shifting keeps your usage flat when the grid is stressed.**

The service coordinates batteries, EVs, and thermal storage so your meter never hits fee-triggering peaks.

It forecasts stress hours in advance, charges assets off-peak, then discharges strategically when prices or usage spike.

## Who's it for

Homes and microbusinesses facing **high peak demand fees** or grid stress events. Ideal for properties with home batteries, bidirectional EVs, or thermal storage that can absorb or release energy on command.

## What's the value

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="Forecast and flatten peaks" icon="waveform">
    Machine learning spots upcoming spikes from EV charging, cooking, or sauna sessions and tops up storage ahead of time.\
    **Result:** your draw stays below penalty thresholds.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Move flexible loads out of danger" icon="repeat">
    Dishwashers, laundry, and other deferrable loads pause during stressed periods and resume in calm hours.\
    **Result:** lower per-kWh costs and less strain on the grid.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Coordinate every storage asset" icon="battery-charging">
    Batteries, V2H EVs, and thermal tanks discharge together at peak, then recover when prices soften.\
    **Result:** maximum self-reliance with a calmer load profile.

## How it works

![Diagram showing forecast analytics charging a battery before peak, then discharging during the high-load window while flexible loads pause.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Forecast load & prices:** Using smart meter data, weather, and occupancy signals, the engine flags likely peak intervals 12-24 hours in advance.
2. **Stage assets:** Batteries and EVs charge beforehand during cheap hours; thermal stores pre-heat or pre-cool while prices are low.
3. **Shave the peak:** During the predicted window, the system discharges storage and defers flexible loads so net grid import stays flat.
4. **Recover smartly:** After the peak, deferred loads resume and storage refills once prices normalise.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="15:00 - Forecast detects spike">
    Weather + occupancy models forecast a 7 kW household peak between 17:30-19:00 due to EV charging and cooking.
  </Step>
  <Step title="16:00 - Assets charge off-peak">
    Home battery tops up to 90% using low midday rates. EV charging is postponed with a ready-by time of 07:00.
  </Step>
  <Step title="17:30 - Peak begins">
    Battery discharges at 3.5 kW, hot water tank switches to stored heat, dishwasher cycle is delayed 90 minutes.
  </Step>
  <Step title="19:00 - Peak avoided">
    Metered draw never exceeds 3.2 kW. Demand charge threshold (5 kW) is never hit, avoiding **450 kr** in penalties this month.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Why it matters now

Utilities across Europe and North America are increasing demand charges and rolling out dynamic peak pricing. Homes that stay flat avoid punitive fees and contribute to a more resilient, decarbonised grid.

---

## Pricing

### Residential plan

Peak shaving is bundled with Savings Pack for homeowners. Expect a **2,990 SEK** onboarding and **199 SEK/month** subscription that covers forecasting, automation, and continuous tuning.

### Commercial plan

Larger premises with complex load profiles are priced by scope. Typical deployments range from **9,900 - 29,900 SEK** for setup, plus **990 - 2,490 SEK/month** for monitoring and optimisation.

## Installation

No invasive work is required: we connect to your smart meter, battery gateway, EV charger, and controllable loads through APIs. Technicians only visit if you need additional CT clamps or smart relays installed.

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a battery to benefit?">
    Batteries increase the payoff, but homes with thermal storage or shiftable loads still avoid demand charges. We model impact before deployment.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this interfere with my daily routines?">
    No. You set comfort and availability limits. The system stays within those guardrails while smoothing your load curve.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How quickly does the system react to unexpected peaks?">
    Real-time monitoring adjusts dispatch in seconds. If a surprise spike appears, peak shaving kicks in automatically.
