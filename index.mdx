## Marketing That Works: Our Winning Formula

We've learned what resonates most with homeowners. The principles below are the foundation of our marketing and the reason customers get excited about our products. Use them as inspiration for your own campaigns and conversations.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Focus on Financial Wins" icon="dollar-circle">
    Homeowners feel the pain of high bills. Lead with the most powerful message: **slashing costs** and **generating real income**. It’s an immediate, tangible benefit that cuts through the noise.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Keep it Simple. Sell the Outcome." icon="chat-check">
    Avoid technical jargon. Customers don't need to know about "API integrations" or "price arbitrage." They want to know it's an "effortless" little box that works automatically with brands they already trust.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Use Real-World Proof" icon="user-check">
    Abstract promises are forgettable. Real results are convincing. Use tangible figures from our case studies, like **"Mikael saved 1,850 kr in one month,"** to build trust and show what's possible.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tell a Revolutionary Story" icon="sparkles">
    This isn't just another gadget. It's a fundamental change in a homeowner's relationship with energy. Frame it as moving from a passive bill-payer to an intelligent, empowered participant in the energy market.
