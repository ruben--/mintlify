The service reads live grid emission data and moves flexible loads into the cleanest hours. Heat pumps, appliances, and batteries adjust without you needing to change habits.

You keep the same comfort while lowering your footprint every single day.

## Who's it for

Climate-conscious households with smart appliances, EV chargers, or heat pumps who want measurable emission reductions without manual effort. Especially valuable in regions with **high hourly carbon variation** like the UK, Nordics, and California.

## What's the value

<CardGroup cols={1}>
  <Card title="See the clean hours ahead" icon="globe-2">
    Data from ENTSO-E, National Grid ESO, Ember, and local sources forecast carbon intensity for the next 24 hours.\
    **Result:** you know the green windows before they begin.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Run flexible loads when the grid is clean" icon="repeat">
    Smart plugs, EV charging, and heat pumps slide into those low-carbon slots while honouring your comfort rules.\
    **Result:** lower emissions with no lifestyle changes.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Store clean energy for later" icon="battery-charging">
    Batteries and thermal stores fill during green hours, then cover evening peaks when the grid dirties up.\
    **Result:** fewer high-carbon imports during the dirtiest periods.

## How it works

![Diagram showing carbon intensity forecast feeding automation that schedules EV charging, heat pump operation, and battery charging.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Collect carbon forecasts:** Pull regional carbon intensity data with hourly (or sub-hourly) resolution.
2. **Rank hours & set thresholds:** Identify your cleanest bands, define acceptable carbon limits, and map them to device availability.
3. **Dispatch smartly:** Automation schedules loads and storage actions to stay within carbon targets while meeting user needs.
4. **Report impact:** Daily and monthly reports quantify kg CO₂ avoided versus unmanaged operation.

## Proof it works

<Steps>
  <Step title="07:00 - Carbon alert">
    Forecast shows 130 gCO₂/kWh overnight, peaking at 320 gCO₂/kWh during the evening.
  </Step>
  <Step title="10:00 - Clean window opens">
    Heat pump boosts domestic hot water while intensity dips to 110 gCO₂/kWh. Dishwasher and laundry cycles begin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="15:00 - Battery charges green">
    PV surplus tops up remaining capacity; automation tops off with grid power at 105 gCO₂/kWh to cover the evening.
  </Step>
  <Step title="19:00 - Dirty peak avoided">
    Battery and stored hot water serve the home while the grid sits at 310 gCO₂/kWh. Emissions reduced by **3.6 kg CO₂** vs unmanaged baseline.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How much carbon can I realistically save?">
    Typical homes cut emissions 15-35%, depending on how flexible their loads are. We provide baseline vs. optimised reporting so you can track progress.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this affect comfort or hot water availability?">
    No. You define temperature and readiness limits, and the system stays within them while chasing the cleanest hours.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need solar or a battery?">
    They help, but aren't required. Even without storage, shifting loads into low-carbon windows delivers meaningful reductions.
