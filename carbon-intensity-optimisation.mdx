# What If Your Home Followed the Cleanest Hours?

**Carbon Intensity Optimisation. Lower your footprint by running on the cleanest electricity available.**

Carbon Intensity Optimisation continuously tracks the grid's emissions profile and shifts your flexible loads into the lowest-carbon windows. Instead of reacting to static schedules, it uses live carbon data to orchestrate when appliances run, when heat pumps pre-condition, and when batteries charge.

The result: the same comfort and convenience, with a dramatically smaller carbon footprint and cleaner energy mix‚Äîautomatically.

## Who it's for

Climate-conscious households with smart appliances, EV chargers, or heat pumps who want measurable emission reductions without manual effort. Especially valuable in regions with **high hourly carbon variation** like the UK, Nordics, and California.

## How Carbon Intensity Optimisation makes it happen

### üåç It tracks grid carbon in real time

Integrations with ENTSO-E, National Grid ESO, Ember, and other data sources provide 24-hour forecasts of grid carbon intensity.\
**Result:** the system knows the cleanest hours before they arrive.

### üîÑ It reschedules flexible loads accordingly

Smart plugs, laundry, EV charging, and heat pumps are shifted into low-carbon windows while respecting comfort constraints.\
**Result:** meaningful emissions cuts without lifestyle sacrifice.

### üîã It charges storage with clean energy

Batteries and thermal stores fill during green hours, then power the home when the grid turns dirty.\
**Result:** fewer high-carbon imports during polluting peaks.

## How It Works: Carbon-Aware Automation

1. **Collect carbon forecasts:** Pull regional carbon intensity data with hourly (or sub-hourly) resolution.
2. **Rank hours & set thresholds:** Identify your cleanest bands, define acceptable carbon limits, and map them to device availability.
3. **Dispatch smartly:** Automation schedules loads and storage actions to stay within carbon targets while meeting user needs.
4. **Report impact:** Daily and monthly reports quantify kg CO‚ÇÇ avoided versus unmanaged operation.

## Carbon-Aware Day: UK Example

<Steps>
  <Step title="07:00 - Carbon alert">
    Forecast shows 130 gCO‚ÇÇ/kWh overnight, peaking at 320 gCO‚ÇÇ/kWh during the evening.
  </Step>
  <Step title="10:00 - Clean window opens">
    Heat pump boosts domestic hot water while intensity dips to 110 gCO‚ÇÇ/kWh. Dishwasher and laundry cycles begin.
  </Step>
  <Step title="15:00 - Battery charges green">
    PV surplus tops up remaining capacity; automation tops off with grid power at 105 gCO‚ÇÇ/kWh to cover the evening.
  </Step>
  <Step title="19:00 - Dirty peak avoided">
    Battery and stored hot water serve the home while the grid sits at 310 gCO‚ÇÇ/kWh. Emissions reduced by **3.6 kg CO‚ÇÇ** vs unmanaged baseline.
  </Step>
</Steps>
