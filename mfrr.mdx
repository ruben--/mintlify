**The pitch:** Get dispatched when the grid needs major balancing—earn big.\
**Revenue:** 5,000-18,000 SEK/year per 10 kWh (higher during activations).\
**Who it's for:** Utility-scale batteries or aggregators that can deliver ≥5 MW on 15-min notice.

# Turn Flexibility Into Fast Restoration Revenue.

**mFRR. Dispatchable reserve that balances the grid when it matters most.**

Manual Frequency Restoration Reserve (mFRR) is the Nordic operator’s call-up force for significant imbalances. Fever connects your assets to this lucrative market, handling qualification, bid placement, and automated activation so you earn every time the grid needs help.

For years, participating in mFRR meant phone calls, control-room staffing, and complex compliance. Fever replaces that friction with software—letting you monetise flexibility from batteries, EV fleets, and controllable loads in seconds.

## Who it’s for

Ideal for **utility-scale batteries**, **industrial sites with curtailable load**, and **aggregators** that can deliver ≥5 MW on 15-minute notice in Finland, Sweden, Norway, or Denmark.

## How mFRR makes it happen

### It keeps you grid-operator ready
Fever streams real-time telemetry, validates availability, and syncs with TSO dispatch queues automatically.\
**Result:** instant readiness when activation orders arrive.

### It chases the highest-value bids
Day-ahead and intraday price signals feed optimisation models that size bids and stack them alongside FCR-D/FCR-N commitments.\
**Result:** higher revenue per MW with no over-commitment risk.

### It delivers on every activation
When the TSO calls mFRR, Fever executes control profiles, verifies delivery, and records settlement data without operator intervention.\
**Result:** consistent performance bonuses and zero missed calls.

## How it works: Automated restoration workflow

<Steps>
  <Step title="Qualify the asset">
    Fever audits ramp rates, communications, and redundancy requirements before submitting participation forms to the TSO.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Forecast + bid">
    Optimisation models select delivery blocks with the best combination of activation probability and price uplift.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Standby mode">
    Assets maintain readiness with periodic health checks and availability signals streamed to the control centre.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Activation + settlement">
    Fever executes the dispatch profile, logs energy delivered, and reconciles capacity plus activation payments on your behalf.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What’s the minimum bid size?">
    Nordic TSOs accept bids from 5 MW upwards. Fever aggregates smaller sites so fleets clear this threshold without new hardware.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How fast must assets respond?">
    mFRR requires delivery within 15 minutes of activation. Fever manages ramp profiles to ensure sustained output throughout the activation window.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I participate if I already provide FCR?">
    Yes. Fever schedules reserve bands so FCR and mFRR commitments never conflict, letting you stack revenue streams.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How are penalties avoided?">
    Availability monitoring and fallback assets guarantee activation delivery. If an issue occurs, Fever handles de-rating and root-cause reporting automatically.
