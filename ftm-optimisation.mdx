Utility-scale batteries, solar farms, and hybrid sites thrive when they participate in every lucrative market—from arbitrage to reserves to local flex. Fever’s FTM Optimisation orchestrates those plays automatically, stacking income streams while respecting grid agreements and operational limits.

Instead of juggling vendors, dispatch consoles, and spreadsheets, operators get a single platform that plans, executes, and settles every action 24/7.
