StopLoss is the intelligent solar protection system that automatically stops your inverter from exporting energy to the grid during negative price periods‚Äîensuring you never pay money to give away the electricity you generated.

For decades, solar owners exported all excess production to the grid without thinking twice. But as renewable penetration increases, a new problem has emerged: **negative electricity prices**.

During periods of extreme oversupply (sunny days with high wind production and low demand), grid electricity prices can go negative‚Äîmeaning if you export solar energy, you're actually **charged money** instead of earning revenue.

StopLoss monitors real-time and forecasted electricity prices 24/7 and automatically blocks export when prices turn negative, redirecting excess solar to controlled loads, batteries, or simply curtailing production to protect your bottom line.

---

## Who it's for

Perfect for solar system owners in **Sweden** and the **Nordics**‚Äîresidential, commercial, or utility-scale‚Äîwho are exposed to spot market prices and want to protect their solar investment from negative price penalties.

---

## How StopLoss makes it happen

### üõ°Ô∏è It protects your solar revenue

StopLoss continuously monitors Nord Pool spot prices and intraday markets, automatically stopping grid export the moment prices go negative.\
**Result:** **eliminate penalties** that can cost hundreds to thousands of kronor per month during high-solar seasons.

### ‚ö° It redirects energy intelligently

Instead of wasting curtailed solar, StopLoss can redirect excess production to batteries, water heaters, HVAC systems, or other controllable loads‚Äîmaximizing self-consumption.\
**Result:** **zero waste**, maximum value from every kilowatt-hour produced.

### ü§ñ It's completely automatic

StopLoss requires zero manual intervention. It monitors prices, makes decisions in real-time, and protects your system automatically‚Äîeven while you sleep.\
**Result:** **set it and forget it** protection against negative price exposure.

---

## How It Works: Proactive Price Protection

StopLoss isn't reactive; it's predictive protection powered by real-time market data.

![A diagram showing StopLoss monitoring Nord Pool prices and automatically blocking inverter export when prices go negative, while redirecting energy to batteries and loads.](/images/stoploss/how-it-works-diagram.png)

1. **Monitor Prices:** StopLoss continuously tracks real-time and forecasted electricity prices from Nord Pool day-ahead and intraday markets.
2. **Detect Negative Periods:** When prices go negative or are forecasted to go negative within the next hour, StopLoss triggers protection mode.
3. **Block Export:** StopLoss sends a command to your inverter to stop exporting to the grid, either by curtailing production or redirecting to local loads/batteries.
4. **Resume Automatically:** The moment prices return to positive territory, StopLoss re-enables grid export, ensuring you capture every profitable opportunity.

## The Problem: Negative Electricity Prices

### What Are Negative Prices?

Negative electricity prices occur when there's too much generation and too little demand. Instead of earning money for exported electricity, you pay a penalty per kWh sent to the grid.

**Example negative price:** -0.25 kr/kWh

If you export 100 kWh during this period without StopLoss, you **lose 25 kr** instead of earning revenue.

### When Do Negative Prices Occur?

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="High Solar Days" icon="sun">
    Midday on sunny spring/summer days when solar production peaks across the grid simultaneously.
  </Card>
  <Card title="High Wind Events" icon="wind">
    Nights and weekends when wind generation is very high but demand is low (especially combined with solar during the day).
  </Card>
  <Card title="Low Demand Periods" icon="calendar-xmark">
    Holidays, warm weekends, and early mornings when industrial and commercial demand is minimal.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Grid Oversupply" icon="tower-broadcast">
    When renewable generation significantly exceeds real-time consumption capacity and energy storage is full.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### How Often Does This Happen?

Negative price frequency varies by season and location:

- **Spring/Summer (April-August):** 5-20 hours per month in high-solar regions
- **Fall/Winter (September-March):** 1-5 hours per month
- **Extreme events:** Up to 8 consecutive hours during major wind + solar oversupply

**Trend:** Negative price hours are **increasing** as renewable penetration grows across the Nordics.

## StopLoss in Action: A Real Negative Price Day

Here's exactly how StopLoss protects your solar income during a negative price event.

### Example: 10 kW Solar System in Stockholm (Spring Day)

**Scenario:** Sunny Sunday in May. High solar production, low weekend demand, strong wind generation.

<Steps>
  <Step title="08:00 - Morning: Positive prices">
    **Price: 0.65 kr/kWh** (positive)\
    Solar producing 7 kW, home consuming 2 kW, exporting 5 kW to grid.\
    **Export revenue:** 5 kW √ó 0.65 kr = **3.25 kr/hour**\
    StopLoss monitors but takes no action‚Äîprices are positive.
  </Step>
  <Step title="11:00 - Midday: Price forecast alert">
    **Current price: 0.42 kr/kWh**\
    StopLoss detects that prices will go negative from 12:00-16:00 due to grid oversupply.\
    StopLoss prepares to block export in 1 hour.
  </Step>
  <Step title="12:00 - Negative prices begin">
    **Price: -0.18 kr/kWh** (negative)\
    Solar producing 9 kW, home consuming 2 kW, would normally export 7 kW.\
    **StopLoss activates:** Inverter export immediately blocked.\
    Excess 7 kW redirected: 3 kW to battery charging, 2 kW to water heater, 2 kW curtailed.
  </Step>
  <Step title="12:00-16:00 - Protected period (4 hours)">
    **Average price: -0.22 kr/kWh**\
    Without StopLoss: 7 kW export √ó 4 hours √ó -0.22 kr/kWh = **-6.16 kr loss**\
    With StopLoss: 0 kr export, 20 kWh redirected to battery/loads = **0 kr penalty + 20 kWh saved for later use**
  </Step>
  <Step title="16:00 - Prices return to positive">
    **Price: 0.88 kr/kWh** (positive)\
    StopLoss automatically re-enables grid export.\
    Solar producing 6 kW, home consuming 2 kW, exporting 4 kW.\
    **Export revenue resumes:** 4 kW √ó 0.88 kr = **3.52 kr/hour**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Daily result">
    **Negative price exposure:** 4 hours at avg -0.22 kr/kWh\
    **Without StopLoss:** -6.16 kr penalty + lost opportunity from curtailment\
    **With StopLoss:** 0 kr penalty + 20 kWh stored/self-consumed (worth ~12 kr later)\
    **StopLoss protection value:** **~18 kr saved on this day**
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Monthly impact (5 negative price days):** ~**90 kr saved**\
**Annual impact (40 negative price days):** ~**720 kr saved**

### With StopLoss

| Date | Negative Price Hours | Export Blocked | Energy Redirected | Penalty Cost | Value Saved |
|------|----------------------|----------------|-------------------|--------------|-------------|
| May 5 | 12:00-15:00 (3h) | ‚úÖ Yes | 18 kWh to battery | **0 kr** | +18 kWh stored |
| May 12 | 11:00-17:00 (6h) | ‚úÖ Yes | 30 kWh battery, 6 kWh water heater | **0 kr** | +30 kWh stored |
| May 18 | 13:00-16:00 (3h) | ‚úÖ Yes | 15 kWh to battery | **0 kr** | +15 kWh stored |
| May 22 | 12:00-18:00 (6h) | ‚úÖ Yes | 35 kWh battery, 7 kWh curtailed | **0 kr** | +35 kWh stored |
| May 26 | 14:00-17:00 (3h) | ‚úÖ Yes | 21 kWh to loads | **0 kr** | +21 kWh self-consumed |

**Total May penalties:** **0 kr**\
**Energy saved/redirected:** **119 kWh** (worth ~80-100 kr when used later)\
**StopLoss protection value:** **~130 kr per month** (penalties avoided + energy value)

---

**Annual StopLoss value:** **~1,560 kr saved**

## StopLoss + Battery: Maximum Protection

When combined with battery storage, StopLoss delivers even greater value by redirecting excess solar to batteries during negative price periods, then discharging during evening peaks.

### Example: 10 kW Solar + 15 kWh Battery

**Scenario:** Negative prices from 12:00-16:00, then evening peak prices.

<Steps>
  <Step title="12:00-16:00 - Negative price period">
    **Price: -0.25 kr/kWh**\
    Solar producing 9 kW, home consuming 2 kW.\
    **Without StopLoss:** Export 7 kW √ó 4 hours = 28 kWh at -0.25 kr/kWh = **-7 kr penalty**\
    **With StopLoss:** Redirect 7 kW to battery. Battery charges from 20% to 95% (15 kWh added). **0 kr penalty.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:00-21:00 - Evening peak">
    **Price: 2.15 kr/kWh** (very high)\
    Home consuming 3 kW √ó 3 hours = 9 kWh needed.\
    **Without StopLoss:** Import 9 kWh from grid at 2.15 kr/kWh = **19.35 kr cost**\
    **With StopLoss:** Discharge 9 kWh from battery (charged for free during negative period). **0 kr cost.**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Daily result">
    **Without StopLoss:** -7 kr penalty + 19.35 kr grid cost = **26.35 kr total cost**\
    **With StopLoss:** 0 kr penalty + 0 kr grid cost = **0 kr**\
    **StopLoss + Battery value:** **26.35 kr saved per day**
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Monthly value (10 negative price days):** ~**265 kr saved**\
**Annual value:** ~**3,180 kr saved**

## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens to curtailed solar energy?">
    StopLoss prioritizes redirection over curtailment. Excess solar is first sent to batteries (if available), then to controllable loads (water heaters, HVAC, etc.), and only curtailed as a last resort. You maximize the value of every kilowatt-hour produced.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I manually override StopLoss if I want to export anyway?">
    Yes. You always have manual control via the app. You can disable StopLoss protection temporarily if you prefer to export during negative prices for any reason.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does StopLoss work with net metering agreements?">
    StopLoss is most valuable with spot-price-based export compensation. If you have a fixed net metering rate (e.g., always paid 0.60 kr/kWh regardless of market prices), you're not exposed to negative prices and don't need StopLoss.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How often do negative prices actually occur?">
    Frequency varies by region and season. Southern Sweden sees more negative hours due to higher solar density. On average, expect 30-80 hours per year, concentrated in spring and summer. This number is increasing annually as renewable penetration grows.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this affect my solar system warranty?">
    No. StopLoss uses manufacturer-approved APIs and control protocols. It operates within safe inverter parameters and does not void warranties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can StopLoss predict negative prices before they happen?">
    Yes. StopLoss monitors both day-ahead and intraday price forecasts, typically providing 12-24 hours advance notice of negative price periods. This allows for pre-emptive battery charging and load scheduling.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I don't have a battery‚Äîis StopLoss still worth it?">
    Yes. Even without a battery, StopLoss prevents penalties by curtailing export during negative periods. If you have controllable loads (water heater, EV charger, heat pump), StopLoss can redirect excess solar to those instead of wasting it.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Absolutely. We use end-to-end encryption and adhere to GDPR compliance. Your solar production data is anonymized and used solely for optimization.
  </Accordion>
