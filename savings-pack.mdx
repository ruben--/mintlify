## Proof it works

### Behind-the-meter optimisation: real examples

Here's exactly how Savings Pack optimises your energy usage throughout a typical day.

### Example 1: Battery + Solar Optimisation (Residential)

**Scenario:** A villa in Stockholm with 15 kWh battery, 8 kW solar array, and typical household consumption.

**What Savings Pack Does:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="02:00 - Night charging">
    **Price: 0.45 kr/kWh** (very low)
    Battery is charged from grid to 90% capacity. Solar won't produce for hours, so we lock in cheap rates.
  </Step>
  <Step title="09:00 - Solar production begins">
    **Price: 0.82 kr/kWh** (moderate)
    Stop grid import. Battery discharges to cover household loads. All solar production goes to battery or exports to grid.
  </Step>
  <Step title="14:00 - Peak solar, low demand">
    **Price: 0.65 kr/kWh** (low)
    Battery fully charged. Excess solar exports to grid. Savings Pack automatically runs dishwasher, washing machine during this window.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:00 - Evening price spike">
    **Price: 2.35 kr/kWh** (very high)
    Battery discharges to cover all household loads. Zero grid import during most expensive hours. Potential export of excess capacity for revenue.
  </Step>
  <Step title="22:00 - Prices drop">
    **Price: 0.88 kr/kWh** (moderate)
    Battery at 30%. Savings Pack waits—prices will drop further overnight. No charging yet.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Daily Result:**
- **Without optimisation:** 68 kWh consumed × avg 1.15 kr/kWh = **78.20 kr**
- **With Savings Pack:** 22 kWh grid (cheap hours) × 0.48 kr/kWh + 46 kWh solar/battery = **10.56 kr** + 12 kWh exported × 0.65 kr/kWh = **-7.80 kr revenue**
- **Daily savings:** **75.44 kr** (96% reduction)

---

### Example 2: HVAC + Heat Pump Optimisation (Commercial)

**Scenario:** A 1,200 m² office building in Malmö with smart HVAC system and ground-source heat pump.

**What Savings Pack Does:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="04:00 - Pre-heat before occupancy">
    **Price: 0.52 kr/kWh** (low)
    Heat pump runs at full capacity to bring building to 22°C before staff arrive. Building thermal mass stores heat efficiently.
  </Step>
  <Step title="08:00 - Staff arrives">
    **Price: 1.18 kr/kWh** (high)
    HVAC reduces to maintenance mode. Building retains heat from pre-heating. Minimal energy consumption during expensive morning hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="12:00 - Midday demand peak">
    **Price: 1.42 kr/kWh** (very high)
    Occupancy sensors detect lunch break. HVAC reduces ventilation rates in empty zones. Temperature setpoint adjusted to 21°C—barely noticeable, huge savings.
  </Step>
  <Step title="15:00 - Prices moderate">
    **Price: 0.95 kr/kWh** (moderate)
    HVAC resumes normal operation. Temperature returns to 22°C. Air quality optimised for afternoon productivity.
  </Step>
  <Step title="17:00 - Staff leaves">
    **Price: 1.85 kr/kWh** (peak)
    HVAC immediately enters minimal mode. Setpoint drops to 18°C. No cooling/heating during most expensive evening hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="22:00 - Night mode">
    **Price: 0.68 kr/kWh** (low)
    Minimal ventilation. Temperature maintained at 16°C. Saves on both heating and electricity.
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Daily Result:**
- **Without optimisation:** 480 kWh consumed × avg 1.12 kr/kWh = **537.60 kr**
- **With Savings Pack:** Load shifted to cheap hours, reduced consumption: 385 kWh × avg 0.71 kr/kWh = **273.35 kr**
- **Daily savings:** **264.25 kr** (49% reduction)
- **Annual savings:** ~**96,500 kr**

### Example 3: EV Charging + Battery + Solar (Residential)

**Scenario:** A homeowner with Tesla Model 3, home battery, and solar panels needs 40 kWh charge for tomorrow's commute.

**What Savings Pack Does:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="16:00 - Car plugged in">
    **Price: 1.95 kr/kWh** (very high)
    Savings Pack detects car connection but doesn't start charging. Battery is at 60%, solar producing 3 kW. Solar goes directly to home loads, battery stays reserved.
  </Step>
  <Step title="19:00 - Evening peak">
    **Price: 2.15 kr/kWh** (peak)
    Still no EV charging. Home loads are covered by battery discharge. Solar production ending. EV still at 20%.
  </Step>
  <Step title="01:00 - Night valley pricing">
    **Price: 0.38 kr/kWh** (extremely low)
    EV charging begins at full 11 kW rate. Home battery also charges simultaneously. Grid import at maximum but prices are at absolute minimum.
  </Step>
  <Step title="05:00 - Charging complete">
    **Price: 0.45 kr/kWh** (very low)
    EV reaches 90% (40 kWh added). Home battery fully charged. Both ready for the day. Grid import stops.
  </Step>
  <Step title="08:00 - Ready to drive">
    Car is fully charged. Home battery is full. Total cost for 40 kWh EV charge: **15.20 kr** (0.38 kr/kWh × 40 kWh)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Daily Result:**
- **Without optimisation:** 40 kWh × avg evening price 1.85 kr/kWh = **74 kr** to charge car
- **With Savings Pack:** 40 kWh × night price 0.38 kr/kWh = **15.20 kr** to charge car
- **Single charge savings:** **58.80 kr** (79% reduction)
- **Monthly savings (20 charges):** **~1,176 kr**

### Example 4: Complete Home Energy Orchestration

**Scenario:** A smart home with solar, battery, heat pump, EV, pool pump, and smart appliances during a winter day.

**What Savings Pack Does:**

**Overnight (00:00-06:00):**
- Battery charges at 0.42 kr/kWh
- EV charges at 11 kW at 0.38 kr/kWh
- Heat pump pre-heats home to 23°C at 0.48 kr/kWh
- Pool pump runs full filtration cycle at 0.41 kr/kWh

**Morning (06:00-12:00):**
- Battery powers home (coffee maker, breakfast, showers)
- Heat pump on minimal maintenance
- EV charging completes
- Solar production begins (9:00) → charges battery

**Midday (12:00-16:00):**
- Solar at peak production
- Dishwasher and washing machine auto-start
- Battery reaches 100%
- Excess solar exports to grid at 0.72 kr/kWh

**Evening Peak (16:00-20:00):**
- Grid prices hit 2.25 kr/kWh
- Battery powers entire home (cooking, lighting, TV, heating)
- Zero grid import during 4-hour peak window
- Heat pump uses thermal mass from morning pre-heating

**Night (20:00-00:00):**
- Prices drop to 0.95 kr/kWh
- Battery at 20% remaining
- Heat pump minimal mode
- Waiting for overnight valley pricing to recharge

**Daily Result:**
- **Grid import:** 35 kWh (all during cheapest hours) × 0.43 kr/kWh = **15.05 kr**
- **Solar production:** 28 kWh (18 kWh self-consumed, 10 kWh exported)
- **Solar export revenue:** 10 kWh × 0.72 kr/kWh = **7.20 kr**
- **Total consumption:** 63 kWh
- **Net cost:** 15.05 kr - 7.20 kr = **7.85 kr**

**Without Savings Pack:**
- 63 kWh × avg price 1.24 kr/kWh = **78.12 kr**

**Daily savings:** **70.27 kr** (90% reduction)
**Annual savings:** **~25,650 kr**
