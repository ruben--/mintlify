## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What's the difference between residential and commercial plans?">

  <Accordion title="Can I cancel the subscription anytime?">
    Yes. Both residential and commercial subscriptions are month-to-month with no long-term commitment. Cancel anytime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if my internet goes down?">
    Savings Pack will default to safe mode. Your equipment continues to function as before installation, but automated optimization pauses until connectivity is restored.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Will this void my equipment warranties?">
    No. Savings Pack uses manufacturer-approved APIs and protocols. It operates within safe device parameters and does not void warranties.
