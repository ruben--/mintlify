Magic Charging is the revolutionary EV charging solution that does more than just find the cheapest hours to charge. It intelligently decides whether it's better to charge at a low price OR get paid to provide grid services with your car's battery‚Äîwhichever puts more money in your pocket.

Traditional smart charging is about one thing: minimizing cost. But what if your EV battery could be more than just a power consumer? What if the money you could earn by stabilizing the grid was worth more than the savings from waiting for the absolute lowest price?

That‚Äôs the magic. Magic Charging constantly evaluates two questions:
1.  **When is it cheapest for me to charge?**
2.  **Can I earn MORE by providing grid services right now than I'd save by waiting?**

Then, it automatically chooses the path that delivers the biggest financial win for you.

## Proof it works

### Magic Charging in action: a typical week

Here's how Magic Charging outperforms standard smart charging over a week of real-world decisions.

#### Example: Tesla Model 3 with 75 kWh battery (needs 50 kWh per week)

**Scenario:** You charge 2-3 times per week, always needing the car ready by 07:00.

| Day | Smart Charging Decision | Magic Charging Decision | Why Magic Wins |
|-----|-------------------------|-------------------------|----------------|
| **Monday** | Charge at 0.38 kr/kWh (02:00-05:00) | **Same:** Charge at 0.38 kr/kWh | No grid service opportunity beats this price. Both strategies identical. |
| | **Cost:** 50 kWh √ó 0.38 kr = **19 kr** | **Cost:** 50 kWh √ó 0.38 kr = **19 kr** | **Net advantage: 0 kr** |
| **Wednesday** | Charge at 0.45 kr/kWh (01:00-04:00) | Charge at 0.72 kr/kWh + provide FCR-D for 6 hours | FCR-D pays 165 kr/MW/hour. Battery qualifies for 60 kW (0.06 MW) capacity. |
| | **Cost:** 50 kWh √ó 0.45 kr = **22.50 kr** | **Cost:** 50 kWh √ó 0.72 kr = **36 kr** | **Capacity payment:** 0.06 MW √ó 165 kr/MW/h √ó 6h = **59.40 kr** |
| | | **Net benefit:** 59.40 kr - 36 kr = **23.40 kr earnings** | **Net advantage: +45.90 kr vs Smart Charging** |
| **Saturday** | Charge at 0.41 kr/kWh (03:00-06:00) | **Same:** Charge at 0.41 kr/kWh | Low grid service prices this weekend. Smart charging is optimal. |
| | **Cost:** 50 kWh √ó 0.41 kr = **20.50 kr** | **Cost:** 50 kWh √ó 0.41 kr = **20.50 kr** | **Net advantage: 0 kr** |

**Weekly comparison:**
- **Smart Charging total cost:** 19 kr + 22.50 kr + 20.50 kr = **62 kr**
- **Magic Charging net cost:** 19 kr - 23.40 kr (earnings) + 20.50 kr = **16.10 kr**
- **Magic Charging advantage:** **45.90 kr per week** (74% better outcome)
- **Annual Magic advantage:** **~2,387 kr additional benefit** beyond smart charging

### Front-of-the-meter optimization: how Magic Charging earns money

Magic Charging leverages your EV battery to participate in the same grid service markets used by utility-scale batteries‚Äîturning your vehicle into a profit center.

#### Revenue stream 1: FCR-D (frequency containment reserve - disturbance)

**What it is:** Your EV battery stands ready to inject or absorb power during major grid frequency disturbances.

**How Magic Charging uses it:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Evening analysis (18:00)">
    Magic Charging sees that FCR-D capacity prices for tonight are **185 kr/MW/hour**.
    Your Tesla Model 3 can provide 60 kW (0.06 MW) of capacity for 6 hours while still charging to meet your 07:00 deadline.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Market bidding (20:00)">
    Magic Charging bids your EV into FCR-D for 00:00-06:00.
    **Bid accepted:** 60 kW capacity at 185 kr/MW/hour.
    **Guaranteed capacity payment:** 0.06 MW √ó 185 kr/MW/h √ó 6h = **66.60 kr**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Charging + grid services (00:00-06:00)">
    Your EV charges as needed (50 kWh at avg 0.68 kr/kWh = **34 kr cost**).
    Battery maintains FCR-D availability throughout charging.
    No activation events occur overnight.
  </Step>
  <Step title="07:00 - Ready to drive">
    Car is fully charged.
    **Total cost:** 34 kr (charging)
    **Total earnings:** 66.60 kr (FCR-D capacity)
    **Net result:** **+32.60 kr profit** (you got paid to charge your car)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Compare to Smart Charging:** Would have charged at 0.42 kr/kWh = 21 kr cost. Magic Charging earned 32.60 kr instead‚Äîa **53.60 kr better outcome**.

---

#### Revenue stream 2: demand response and peak shaving

**What it is:** Local utilities or grid operators pay you to reduce charging or discharge slightly during peak demand events.

**How Magic Charging uses it:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Evening demand forecast (17:00)">
    Magic Charging receives a demand response request: reduce grid load by 10 kW from 18:00-20:00.
    **Compensation:** 120 kr for 2-hour participation.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Delay charging (18:00-20:00)">
    Instead of charging immediately, Magic Charging delays your charge start to 20:00.
    **Earnings:** 120 kr for simply waiting 2 hours.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Charge during off-peak (20:00-23:00)">
    Charging begins at 20:00 when demand response ends.
    Prices have dropped to 0.88 kr/kWh.
    **Charging cost:** 50 kWh √ó 0.88 kr = **44 kr**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Net result">
    **Charging cost:** 44 kr
    **Demand response earnings:** 120 kr
    **Net benefit:** **+76 kr** (you earned money by delaying charging)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Compare to Smart Charging:** Would have charged overnight at 0.38 kr/kWh = 19 kr cost. Magic Charging earned +76 kr instead‚Äîa **95 kr better outcome**.

---

#### Revenue stream 3: V2G (vehicle-to-grid) arbitrage

**What it is:** Charge your EV when prices are very low, then discharge back to the grid during extreme price spikes, earning the spread.

**How Magic Charging uses it:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="Night charging (02:00)">
    **Price: 0.28 kr/kWh** (extremely low due to wind oversupply)
    Magic Charging charges your EV to 95% (70 kWh).
    You only need 50 kWh for tomorrow's driving, so 20 kWh is available for V2G.
    **Cost:** 70 kWh √ó 0.28 kr = **19.60 kr**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Afternoon price spike (17:00 next day)">
    **Price: 3.15 kr/kWh** (extreme spike due to low wind + high demand)
    Magic Charging discharges 20 kWh back to the grid while maintaining 50 kWh for your driving needs.
    **V2G revenue:** 20 kWh √ó 3.15 kr = **63 kr**
  </Step>
  <Step title="Net result">
    **Charging cost:** 19.60 kr (for 70 kWh)
    **V2G earnings:** 63 kr (from 20 kWh)
    **Net cost for your 50 kWh:** 19.60 kr - 63 kr = **-43.40 kr** (you were paid 43.40 kr to charge your car)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Compare to Smart Charging:** Would have charged 50 kWh at 0.35 kr/kWh = 17.50 kr cost. Magic Charging earned -43.40 kr instead‚Äîa **60.90 kr better outcome**.

---

### Real example: monthly comparison

**Scenario:** Tesla Model Y owner in Stockholm, charging ~200 kWh per month (4 times per week).

#### Smart Charging (cost optimization only)

| Week | Charging Sessions | Avg. Price | Total Cost | Net Result |
|------|-------------------|------------|------------|------------|
| Week 1 | 50 kWh √ó 4 | 0.42 kr/kWh | 84 kr | **-84 kr** |
| Week 2 | 50 kWh √ó 4 | 0.38 kr/kWh | 76 kr | **-76 kr** |
| Week 3 | 50 kWh √ó 4 | 0.45 kr/kWh | 90 kr | **-90 kr** |
| Week 4 | 50 kWh √ó 4 | 0.41 kr/kWh | 82 kr | **-82 kr** |

**Monthly net cost:** **332 kr**

#### Magic Charging (cost + earnings optimization)

| Week | Strategy | Charging Cost | Earnings | Net Result |
|------|----------|---------------|----------|------------|
| Week 1 | 2 smart charges + 2 FCR-D | 42 kr + 68 kr | 135 kr FCR-D | **-110 kr + 135 kr = +25 kr** |
| Week 2 | 3 smart charges + 1 V2G | 57 kr + 36 kr | 68 kr V2G | **-93 kr + 68 kr = -25 kr** |
| Week 3 | 2 smart charges + 2 demand response | 45 kr + 88 kr | 240 kr DR | **-133 kr + 240 kr = +107 kr** |
| Week 4 | 4 smart charges (low grid opportunity) | 82 kr | 0 kr | **-82 kr** |

**Monthly net cost:** **25 kr profit** (you earned money instead of paying)

---

**Magic Charging advantage:** **357 kr per month** better than Smart Charging
**Annual Magic advantage:** **~4,284 kr** additional benefit
