Distribution grids across the Nordics are launching local flexibility markets to relieve congestion and stabilize voltage. Fever’s BRP Flex module aggregates your assets, qualifies them with DSOs, and dispatches them to the highest-paying zones without sacrificing national market earnings.

Instead of spreadsheets and phone calls, BRPs get an always-on platform that handles bidding, verification, and settlement across dozens of municipal programs.

## Who it’s for

Designed for **balance responsible parties**, **municipal utilities**, and **flex aggregators** that manage distributed assets and want streamlined participation in local congestion markets.

## How BRP Flex makes it happen

### It maps flexibility to every feeder
Fever geolocates assets, tags them by feeder/substation, and tracks availability per local market rule.\
**Result:** precise bids that solve the right constraint at the right time.

### It maximizes stackable revenue
Local flex opportunities are evaluated alongside national FCR, mFRR, and arbitrage commitments.\
**Result:** no double-booking, just the best-paying combination every hour.

### It simplifies compliance
Automated measurement & verification, settlement files, and invoicing match each DSO’s template.\
**Result:** zero administrative overhead even when you operate in many municipalities.
