# Stop Paying Peak Prices to Charge Your EV.

**Smart Charging. Effortless overnight optimisation that slashes your charging costs.**


Smart Charging is the intelligent EV charging solution that automatically schedules your vehicle to charge during the cheapest hours of the night—saving you hundreds of kronor every month without any extra effort.

For years, EV owners have plugged in whenever they got home, paying whatever the electricity price happened to be at that moment. Often, that meant charging during expensive evening peak hours.

That era is over. Your EV can now charge intelligently, waiting for the absolute cheapest overnight rates and filling up when prices are at their lowest.

Smart Charging is the simple, automated solution that transforms your EV from an expensive convenience into a smart financial asset—charging only when it makes economic sense.

## Who's it for

Perfect for EV owners in **Sweden** and the **Nordics** who want to minimise charging costs without thinking about electricity prices or manually scheduling charging sessions.

---

## What's the value

### ↓ It slashes your charging costs

Smart Charging analyses Nord Pool spot prices 24 hours ahead and automatically schedules your EV to charge during the cheapest consecutive hours, typically between midnight and 6 AM.\
**Result:** reduce EV charging costs by **50-75%** compared to unoptimised charging.

### ⏰ It charges when you need it

Tell Smart Charging when you need your car ready (e.g., "charged by 7 AM"), and it works backwards to find the cheapest hours that still meet your deadline.\
**Result:** your car is always ready when you need it, and you **never pay more than necessary**.

### ✓ It's completely automatic

Smart Charging works with your existing home charger and EV. Once configured, it runs entirely in the background—you never think about prices again.\
**Result:** **zero effort** after initial setup. Just plug in and save.

---

## How it works

Smart Charging isn't guesswork; it's predictive optimisation working every night for your wallet.

![A diagram showing Smart Charging analysing 24-hour price forecasts and automatically scheduling charging during the cheapest consecutive hours.](/images/smart-charging/how-it-works-diagram.png)

1. **Connect & Configure:** Smart Charging integrates with your home EV charger (Easee, Zaptec, Charge Amps, Tesla Wall Connector, etc.) and learns your charging patterns.
2. **Analyze Prices:** Every evening, Smart Charging fetches tomorrow's hourly electricity prices from Nord Pool and identifies the cheapest consecutive hours.
3. **Schedule & Charge:** Smart Charging automatically delays charging until the optimal window begins, then charges your EV at full speed during the cheapest hours.

## Proof it works

### Smart charging in action: a typical night

Here's exactly how Smart Charging optimises a typical charging session.

#### Example: Charging a Tesla Model 3 (60 kWh needed)

**Scenario:** You arrive home at 18:00 and plug in your Tesla. You need the car charged by 07:00 for your morning commute.

**What Smart Charging Does:**

<Steps>
  <Step title="18:00 - Car plugged in">
    **Current price: 1.95 kr/kWh** (very high)\
    Smart Charging detects the car is connected and needs 60 kWh. Instead of starting immediately, it fetches tomorrow's price forecast.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:05 - Price analysis complete">
    **Cheapest 6-hour window identified: 01:00-07:00**\
    Average price during this window: **0.42 kr/kWh**\
    Smart Charging schedules charging to begin at 01:00 and complete by 07:00.
  </Step>
  <Step title="18:00-01:00 - Standby">
    Car remains plugged in but not charging. Electricity prices during this period average **1.65 kr/kWh**.\
    **Avoided cost:** 60 kWh × 1.65 kr/kWh = **99 kr**
  </Step>
  <Step title="01:00 - Charging begins">
    **Price: 0.38 kr/kWh**\
    Smart Charging starts charging at full 11 kW rate. Overnight prices are at their absolute lowest.
  </Step>
  <Step title="06:30 - Charging complete">
    **Average price during charging: 0.42 kr/kWh**\
    60 kWh delivered over 5.5 hours.\
    **Total cost:** 60 kWh × 0.42 kr/kWh = **25.20 kr**
  </Step>
  <Step title="07:00 - Ready to drive">
    Car is fully charged and ready for your commute.\
    **Savings compared to immediate charging:** 99 kr - 25.20 kr = **73.80 kr per charge** (75% reduction)
  </Step>
</Steps>

**Monthly savings (20 charges):** ~**1,476 kr**\
**Annual savings:** ~**17,712 kr**

### Real example: winter charging comparison

**Scenario:** A Volvo XC40 Recharge owner in Malmö needs 50 kWh per charge, charging 4 times per week.

#### Without Smart Charging (charging immediately at 18:00)

| Day | Charging Start | Avg. Price | Energy | Cost per Charge |
|-----|----------------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Monday | 18:00 | 1.85 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 92.50 kr |
| Wednesday | 18:00 | 1.72 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 86.00 kr |
| Friday | 18:00 | 2.05 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 102.50 kr |
| Sunday | 18:00 | 1.58 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 79.00 kr |

**Weekly cost:** **360 kr**\
**Monthly cost:** ~**1,440 kr**\
**Annual cost:** ~**17,280 kr**

---

#### With Smart Charging (charging overnight at cheapest hours)

| Day | Charging Start | Avg. Price | Energy | Cost per Charge |
|-----|----------------|------------|--------|-----------------|
| Monday | 02:00 | 0.45 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 22.50 kr |
| Wednesday | 01:30 | 0.38 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 19.00 kr |
| Friday | 02:30 | 0.52 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 26.00 kr |
| Sunday | 01:00 | 0.41 kr/kWh | 50 kWh | 20.50 kr |

**Weekly cost:** **88 kr**\
**Monthly cost:** ~**352 kr**\
**Annual cost:** ~**4,224 kr**

---

**Annual savings with Smart Charging:** **13,056 kr** (76% reduction)

## Frequently asked questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What if I need my car charged immediately?">
    You can always override Smart Charging and start charging immediately via the app or your charger. Smart Charging resumes automatic optimization on the next session.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does this work with my EV?">
    Smart Charging works with any electric vehicle as long as you have a compatible home charger. The intelligence is in the charger scheduling, not the car itself.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if electricity prices don't vary much?">
    Even in low-variability periods, Smart Charging finds the cheapest hours and saves you money. In high-variability periods (winter, peak demand), savings are dramatically higher.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I set different charging deadlines for different days?">
    Yes. You can configure different ready-by times for weekdays vs. weekends, or set custom schedules for specific days.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What happens if prices change after scheduling?">
    Smart Charging monitors intraday price updates and can adjust your charging schedule if significantly cheaper hours become available.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Smart Charging work with solar panels?">
    Yes. Smart Charging can prioritize solar self-consumption during the day and use overnight grid charging only when solar isn't available—maximizing both solar usage and cost savings.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Is my data secure?">
    Absolutely. We use end-to-end encryption and adhere to GDPR compliance. Your charging data is anonymized and used solely for optimization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Smart Charging with a subscription electricity plan?">
    Smart Charging is most effective with hourly spot pricing contracts. If you have a fixed-rate plan, the savings will be minimal since your price doesn't vary by hour.
