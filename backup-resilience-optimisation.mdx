# What If Outages Felt Like Non-Events?

**Backup & Resilience Optimisation. Keep your home running during blackouts.**

Backup & Resilience Optimisation ensures the lights stay on, the fridge stays cold, and critical circuits are powered whenever the grid fails. By orchestrating batteries, EV-to-home systems, and smart circuits, it shifts stored energy toward essential loads the moment an outage hits.

It also prepares in advance‚Äîmonitoring grid conditions, charging reserves ahead of storms, and preserving capacity for multi-hour events. Comfort and safety are maintained without frantic manual switching.

## Who it's for

Homes in regions with **frequent outages, severe weather, or weak rural grids**. Ideal for households with stationary batteries, bidirectional EVs, or smart load panels that can isolate and prioritise circuits.

## How Backup & Resilience Optimisation makes it happen

### üõ†Ô∏è It prepares before outages strike

Storm forecasts, grid stress alerts, and utility notifications trigger pre-charging of batteries and EVs while prices are still low.\
**Result:** maximum stored energy just in time for potential outages.

### üîå It isolates and powers critical circuits

Smart panels or subpanels prioritise essentials‚Äîheating, refrigeration, lighting, communications‚Äîwhile shedding non-critical loads automatically.\
**Result:** extended runtime and higher comfort during blackouts.

### üì∂ It monitors and adapts in real time

During an outage, the system tracks remaining capacity, forecasts runtime, and staggers discretionary loads so reserves stretch farther.\
**Result:** no surprises, just calm, informed resilience.

## How It Works: Anticipate, Island, Sustain

![Diagram showing grid outage triggering battery + EV-to-home powering critical circuits via smart panel.](/images/hero-dark.png)

1. **Watch the grid:** Continuously ingest weather data, outage feeds, and local grid frequency to anticipate risk.
2. **Stage energy:** Charge batteries and EVs to target state-of-charge and top up thermal reserves before impact.
3. **Island instantly:** When voltage drops, island critical circuits using smart panels while storage assets take over.
4. **Manage runtime:** Dynamically adjust load priorities and notify occupants as reserve thresholds change.

## Resilience in Action: Storm Response Timeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="12 hours before">
    Storm alert triggers 100% charge on home battery and 80% minimum on EV via V2H. Hot water tank pre-heats to store thermal energy.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Outage begins">
    Grid voltage collapse is detected. Smart panel islands critical loads within 150 ms; non-essential circuits shed automatically.
  </Step>
  <Step title="3 hours in">
    Battery at 55% SOC, EV supplying 3 kW. Laundry and dishwasher remain paused; fridge, lighting, Wi-Fi stay powered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Power restored">
    System resynchronises with the grid, recharges reserves, and exports performance report showing **0 minutes of critical downtime**.
  </Step>
</Steps>
